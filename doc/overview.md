* Rhamy -- semantic LaTeX to output (see below)


### Semantic Incorporation in Sum, Product, Continued Fraction, Derivative, Limit and other Operator LaTeX expressions (Claude)

Brief description: Claude will write software which will replace and 
insert semantic LaTeX macros for various mathematical operators 
encountered in the DLMF and DRMF for orthogonal polynomial and special 
function formulae. Claude's software will rely on parsing tools for 
LaTeX source trees.

### PHP Translation of Input LaTeX Mathematical Source to Output Formula Representations (Rhamy)

Brief description:  Rhamy will write PHP code which performs 
translations of input LaTeX source for mathematical formulae into 
various output representations such as Mathematica, MathML, and Maple 
code.  This PHP code will be integrated into MediaWiki installations 
located at Wikitech in DRMF instances. Corresponding graphical 
interfaces for the translation software will be developed as well.
