### (Jimmy Li) DRMF Formulae Search Backend & NTCIR-12 Competition

Brief description: Based on the NTCIR-11 and NTCIR-10 contributions, Jimmy will 
optimize the formula search backend and provide easy accessible REST interface for 
DRMF formula search.  Jimmy will also prepare for a submission to the NTCIR-12
Competition.

### (Akash Shah) DRMF Formula Search MediaWiki Frontend

Brief description: Akash will improve the frontend for DRMF formula search to make
it more usable and stable. The input for formula search needs more guidance and 
examples of how to use it.  For the output contents, summarization is desirable.
Query refinement technologies need to be developed. The interface to the backend
relies on the standardized NTCIR formula retreival format.

### (Divya Gandla) DRMF eCF Seeding Project

Brief description:  Divya is developing code to convert Mathematica source to 
DRMF semantic LaTeX.  Her focus will be primarily on conversion of the Mathematica 
eCF dataset.

### (Shraya Madhu) DRMF DLMF Seeding Project

Brief description: Shraeya is developing code to convert NIST Digital Library of 
Mathematical Functions LaTeX source code into DRMF semantic LaTeX.  Shraeya 
will focus on converting DLMF Chapters 5, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18 to Wikitext.

### (Claude Zou) DRMF Semantic LaTeX Mathematical Operator Replacements

Brief description: Claude will write software which will replace and 
insert semantic LaTeX macros for various mathematical operators 
encountered in the DLMF and DRMF for orthogonal polynomial and special 
function formulae. Claude's software will rely on parsing tools for 
LaTeX source trees.  Claude will focus on replacements of sum, product, 
continued fraction, derivative, limit and other mathematical operator expressions.

### (Rhamy Belayachi) DRMF Computer Algebra Systems Output

Brief description:  Rhamy will develop code which performs translations of input 
DRMF semantic LaTeX source for mathematical formulae into various computer algebra 
systems (CAS) code such as those used by the Mathematica and Maple.  Corresponding 
graphical interfaces for the translation software will be developed.
