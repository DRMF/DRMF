----------------------Connecting to an instance:--------------------
	--An SSH key allows you to connect and communicate with a trusted server (e.g. drmf-ecf) without repeatedly re-entering passwords or other sensitive data.--

-Create an SSH key: "$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C 'your_email@youremail.com'"
-It will then prompt you for the save location, which you want to keep as default, so just hit enter
-It will then ask for a passowrd. Enter a password if you want one, otherwise just hit enter
-Add the code below the config file in the .ssh/ folder (this configures the SSH key to connect to drmf-ecf via localhosts):
"Host bastion1.eqiad.wmflabs
    Hostname bastion.wmflabs.org
    ProxyCommand none

Host bastion2.eqiad.wmflabs
    Hostname bastion2.wmflabs.org
    ProxyCommand none

Host bastion3.eqiad.wmflabs
    Hostname bastion3.wmflabs.org
    ProxyCommand none

Host *.eqiad.wmflabs
    ProxyCommand ssh -a -W %h:%p bastion1.eqiad.wmflabs

Host *.wmflabs
    User GERRITUSERNAME

Host INSTANCENAME
    HostName INSTANCENAME.eqiad.wmflabs
    ProxyCommand ssh -a -W %h:%p bastion2.eqiad.wmflabs
    User GERRITUSERNAME
    LocalForward 2222 localhost:22
    LocalForward 8080 localhost:80"

-From now on all you have to do to connect to the instance is "ssh INSTANCENAME" (current instance name is 'ecf')

----------------------------Committing to Gerrit:--------------------------
	--Gerrit is a cooperative platform which allows other users to review your code. You have locally stored commits - files you want to be reviewed - which can be pushed for review on Gerrit.--

-Save the id_rsa content under your account WikiMedia-->Settings-->SSH Public Keys
-cd into folder of commitment (~/MathSearch)
-"git status" to check modified files
-"git add ~insert file name~" for commitment
-"git commit" to update the local commit files
-Add project description/title to file
-"git commit --amend --author='name <email>'" to change author info
-"git remote -v"
-"git review" to push for review on gerrit OR (if "git review" doesn't work) "git push [remote name] HEAD:refs/for/master" 
-"scp -p -P 29418 sharmaans@gerrit.wikimedia.org:hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/" to commit

-------------------------Check changes/commitment:------------------------

-Log onto WikiMedia
-Check Changes under personal settings

-------------------------Squashing commits:-------------------------------
	--Multiple commits can be squashed into a single upload on a branch with multiple patches.--

-cd into folder of commitment (~/MathSearch)
-"git rebase -i HEAD~1"
-Replace "pick" in commit message with "squash"
-"git review" to push for review on gerrit

------------------------Installing & Configuring PHPStorm:-----------------------
	--PHPStorm is an integrated development environment for PHP, HTML, and other forms of web development. It makes life much easier. Use it to store, edit, review, and upload files.--

-Download the PHPStorm file (https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/)
-In terminal, navigate to the directory which contains the downloaded file using the cd command (usually your downloads folder)
-Use "tar xfz PhpStorm-*.tar.gz" to unplack it
-Use "cd PhpStorm-*", and then "cd bin" to get to directory with the install file (PhpStorm.sh)
-Use "./phpstorm.sh" to start the install
-Go through the installation process, and enter you license key when prompted for it (free license keys are given for MediaWiki development)
-Settings-->Build, Execution, Deployment-->Deployment
-Click [+] and create a new Server with the name localhost and type SFTP
-
-Enter local host and port number (localhost, 2222 respectively for this config file)
-Enter GERRITUSERNAME
-Link to id_rsa file (should be in .ssh folder at Home) under Private key file
-Should be finished now

----------------------In case PHPStorm is dysfunctional:-----------------------
-cd into directory of PhpStorm project
-scp to create upload file to instance ("scp filename USERNAME@drmf-ecf.eqiad.wmflabs:~")
-Log onto instance to verify uplaod ("drmf-ecf" or "ssh INSTANCENAME")
-Google your woes -- could potentially be a bug in the software (for instance, a fault in the /lib/jsch-0.1-50.jar file)
